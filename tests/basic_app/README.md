# Basic test app

Note: this currently isn't runnable as a local docker container as the vmruntime requires the metadata server (and perhaps other environmental dependencies) in order to startup. So, instead, this must be manually deployed.

## Deploying & testing.

Run `make deploy` then you can verify it works with `make test`.
