# App Engine Compat Libraries

This folder contains an exported version of the Google App Engine SDK that is used to provide the `google.appengine` APIs to Managed VMs applications.

## Note

Everything in the `exported_appengine_sdk` folder is code that is exported from Google's internal repositories. That means that no modifications to this code can happen in this repository, as it will be overwritten during the next export.
